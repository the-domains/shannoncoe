# **Protect the Joy. **

I had nothing to lose if I tried this new verb. Everything to gain. Immediately, I felt energetic, as if there were a remnant of joy- tinders of previous flames that burned like rocket fuel, hot and fast- were being breathed on.

It was there. Joy. And I began to protect it. Gently at first. Fiercely at the last.

Everything I did, each act of service, every gift given, all my obligations, were filtered through questions about my little, beautiful small flame of joy.

At what point did the meal I was going to serve move from easy and simple to hard and burdensome? **Protect the Joy. **

Where was the line crossed between a simple expression and token of love (not wallet) and having my identity wrapped up in a package? **Protect the Joy.**

I was now aware, so very aware, of tick marks on the moments- like on a face clock, aware of subtle changes where Joy would lesson and something sinister and monstrous would begin to creep into the moment.

Robbing me. Stealing from me. Bankrupting Me.

**Protect the Joy.**
